Project outline

A checklist that has items and sub-items
Each item gets assigned a price
Two parties are able to check off items as completed
Once both parties check off an item then funds are dispersed
There are two versions of the checklist, the internal one and the external one.
    The internal checklist follows the skeleton of the external but can add sub-items and assign people to tasks
    The external checklist is usually less detailed
The checklist contract can have terms for releasing or not releasing funds
    Time period between working party checking an item off, and the paying party accepting
    If the period elapses then half the funds are given to the working party but the paying party can opt out of all future checklist items
The checklist has a schedule, either with each checkpoint or the entire checklist
    The working party must pay to extend the schedule
    The paying party can pay to shorten the schedule

The checklist can interact with another contract that can mint SS tokens
    Make sure that others cannot mint ss tokens who use this (public) contract

The checklist is generated by the contractor and sent to the payer. The payer approves, and the contract is ?locked
